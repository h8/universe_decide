# UniverseDecide

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/h8/universe_decide.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/h8/universe_decide)

This is an example of a project, which uses Elixir, Phoenix, Yarn, Webpack, Babel, React, Jest, ESLint and some other 
modern (as for 2017-2018) technologies and practices, like embedding CSS into React components. 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Run `yarn install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
